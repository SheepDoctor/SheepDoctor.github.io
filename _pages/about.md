Hi there, welcome!<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="28">

I am Bingwen Dong (Ëë£ÁÇ≥Èóª). I am currently persuing my Bachelor's degree at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](www.sustech.edu.cn). I have joint the research group supervised by [Jiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=NHt3fUcAAAAJ) since 2023. I am passionate about deep learning and computer vision, especially in the field of 3D reconstructions. I'm currently working on deoth estimation on fundus area and 3D reconstruction under the circumstances under low-light conditions.

## Research Interests üíª
- 3D reconstruction
- Depth estimation
- Computer vision

## Currently Working on üõ†
- National Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project, with 10,000 RMB fundings by the government of China
  - The goal of the project is to develop a 3D reconstruction system for fundus area of our body, which can be used for medical diagnosis and treatment planning. 
- Guangdong Province Climbing Plan, with 10,000 RMB fundings by the government of Guangdong Province, China
  - The goal of this project is to develop a accurate depth estimation system for fundus area, and will be integrated into the 3D reconstruction system.
